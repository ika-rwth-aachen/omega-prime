Data Model, Format and Python Library for ground truth data containing information on dynamic objects, map and environmental factors optimized for representing urban traffic. The repository contains:
## Data Model and Specification
see [Data Model & Specification](omega_prime_specification.md)

- 🌍 **Data Model**: What signals exist and how these are defined.
- 🧾 **Data Format Specification**: How to exchange and store those signals.

## Python Library
  - 🔨 **Create** omega-prime files from many sources (see [Tutorials/Introduction](notebooks/tutorial.ipynb)):
      - ASAM OSI GroundTruth trace (e.g., output of esmini),  Table of moving object data (e.g., csv data), ASAM OpenDRIVE map
      - [LevelXData datasets](https://levelxdata.com/) through [lxd-io](https://github.com/lenvt/lxd-io)
      - Extend yourself by subclassing [DatasetConverter](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/omega-prime/blob/main/omega_prime/converters/converter.py#L52)
      - Use [omega-prime-trajdata](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/omega-prime-trajdata) to convert motion prediction datasets into omega-prime 
  - 🗺️ **Map Association**: Associate Object Location with Lanes from OpenDRIVE or OSI Maps (see [Tutorials/Locator](notebooks/tutorial_locator.ipynb))
  - 📺 **Plotting** of data: interactive top view plots using [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/)
  - ✅ **Validation** of data: check if your data conforms to the omega-prime specification (e.g., correct yaw) using [pandera](https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
  - 📐 **Interpolation** of data: bring your data into a fixed frequency
  - 📈 **Metrics**: compute interaction metrics like PET, TTC, THW (see [Tutorials/Metrics](notebooks/tutorial_metrics.ipynb))
    - Predicted and observed timegaps based on driving tubes (see [./omega_prime/metrics.py](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/omega-prime/blob/main/omega_prime/metrics.py))
    - 2D-birds-eye-view visibility with [omega-prime-visibility](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/omega-prime-visibility)
  - 🚀 **Fast Processing** directly on DataFrames using [polars](https://pola.rs/), [polars-st](https://oreilles.github.io/polars-st/)
